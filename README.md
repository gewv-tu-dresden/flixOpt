# flixOpt
vector based energy optimization framework in python
## introduction
**flixOpt** is an vector based optimization framework creating and solving mixed-integer programming problems (MILP). It is created with focus of energy flows but can be used for material flows as well.

flixOpt is developed in project SMARTBIOGRID

flixOpt is based on matlab framework flixOptMat developed in project FAKS and has a few influences from [oemof/solph](https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph) (Great thanks for your tool!)
## key features
  * architecture allows integration of other modeling languages than [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/)
  * many constraints available
  * invest optimization
  * segmented linear correlations for
    * flows
    * invest costs and invest size
  * effects 
    * various effects, i.g. costs, CO2 emissions, primary energy, area demand etc.
    * effects coupleable, i.g. specific costs of CO2-emissions
    * constraints, i.g. max sum of CO2 emissions

## performance issues
You can choose between three calculation modes:
  * **full** -> exact and slow
  * **segmented** (with variable time overlap) -> fast but not exact for big storages
  * **aggregated** (automatically creation of typical periods via [TSAM](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/tsam "more info")) -> fast, quite exact
